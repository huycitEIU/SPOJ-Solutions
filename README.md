# SPOJ Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to problems from Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ), created as part of various Lab assignments for courses at Eastern International University (EIU). Each solution is implemented in Java with the following considerations in mind:
- Adherence to coding standards taught at EIU.
- The `class` name matches the problem code on SPOJ.
- Designed primarily to demonstrate problem-solving techniques in Lab sessions.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows to ensure scalability and maintainability as new solutions are added:

### Directory Structure
- `src/`: Contains the Java source code files. Each file corresponds to a particular SPOJ problem, with its `class` name matching the SPOJ problem code (e.g., `ABCDEF`).
- `eiu/`: Package containing utility functions and modules specific to Eastern International University's course structures or reusable components across various solutions.
- `helper/`: Package that includes common helper classes or methods used for repetitive or auxiliary tasks in problem-solving.
- `.idea/`: IntelliJ IDEA project configuration files for ease of setup.
- `SPOJ Solutions.iml`: The project structure file for IntelliJ.

---

## Future Scope

The repository is structured to accommodate solutions from different courses and Lab sessions at EIU. Over time, it may include:
- Solutions from different subjects beyond the current coursework (e.g., CSE 104).
- Additional documentation to enhance usability.

## Notes

This repository serves as a learning resource for students and anyone interested in competitive programming and problem-solving on SPOJ. Feel free to refer to and adapt these solutions for your own academic purposes.
